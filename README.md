# ExplanationsGraph
This is a simple program that retrieves the information from an explanation graph and uses [RosaeNLG](https://rosaenlg.org/) and [Pug templates](https://pugjs.org/) to generate text.  

## Installation  
Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  

Clone the repository and install dependecies
```
git clone https://github.com/radu1690/Explanations.git
npm install
```

## Run
You can run the program with:  
```
node explanations.js <template> <graph>
``` 
Template is the location of the pug template while graph is a graph in csv format (with "\t" as delimiter). Example:  
```
node explanations.js templates/english/argument.pug graphs/exp_graph_1_en.csv
``` 
  
You can specify the language, English or Italian (the default is English), like in the following example:  
```
node explanations.js templates/italian/feedback.pug graphs/exp_graph_1_it.csv italian
```  

## Graphviz
You can generate a visual reppresentation of a graph with [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).  
Install requirements:
```
!apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
!pip install pygraphviz
```

The graph must be in a csv file with ```\t``` delimiter.  

Run with: 
```python graphviz.py <graph> ```  

Example:
```
!python graphviz.py graphs/exp_graph_1_en.csv
```
will generate a pdf file named exp_graph_1_en.pdf with the reppresentation of the graph.

# Explanation graph format
The graphs are stored in csv file (with \t delimiter) where each row contains a triple in the form of "subject - predicate - object": subject is the parent node, object is the child node and predicate is the arc label.  
In every graph the following must be true:
* the subject of the first row is the head node of the graph
* the graph does not contain cycles
* a child node has only one parent node

# Basic templates and RosaeNLG tutorial
For all the features in Pug templates you can check the [Pug main website](https://pugjs.org/).  
A complete tutorial with advanced features of RosaeNLG can be found [here](https://rosaenlg.org/rosaenlg/3.0.0/tutorials/tutorial_en_US.html).
## Plain text
To insert some plain text you can use the pipe character (`|`) followed by the text you want to write:  
```
|Hello world!
```
will output: ```Hello world!```

Spaces between different plain texts (except only punctuation) are automatically inserted, so:
```
|Hello
|world
|!
```
will still output: ```Hello world!``` 

## Variables  
The object passed to RosaeNLG (after the graph has been processed) is an explanation.  
To print a field, you write ```#[+value(explanation.field)]``` or ```!{explanation.field}```. For example, the value of explanation.entity.enLabel is "red meat":  
```
|You ate #[+value(explanation.entity.enLabel)].
```
will output: ```You ate red meat.```  

```#[+value(explanation.field)]``` will throw an error if the field is undefined while ```!{explanation.field}``` will print an empty string.

## Conditionals
If-else statements are used like in the following example where _entity.enLabel=meat_ and _constraint=less_:
```
if explanation.constraint == 'less'
	|You ate too much,
	|enough 
else 
	|You did not eat enough,
	|more
|#[+value(explanation.entity.enLabel)]!
```  
will output: ```You ate too much, enough meat!```  
Note that to use an explanation field in an if-else statement you must not use the ```#[+value()]``` or the ```!{}``` notation.  

## Javascript code, iteration and functions
You can write javascript code in a template by starting the line with the "```-```" character,for example here i declare two variables and then I use them in the template:
```
- let nutrient = "cheese"
- let food = "pie"

|the !{food} contains a lot of !{nutrient}
```
This will output ```The pie contains a lot of cheese```

## Iteration
You can do loop with the ```eachz``` operator from RosaeNLG:
```
-let data = ["fruits", "vegetables", "meat"]
eachz element in data
    |!{data}
```
will output: ```fruits vegetables meat```

The ```eachz``` operator can accept some [parameters](https://rosaenlg.org/rosaenlg/3.0.0/mixins_ref/eachz_itemz.html) which are useful in Natural Language Generation. Example:
```
-let data = ["fruits", "vegetables", "meat"]
|I bought
eachz element in data with {separator: ",", last_separator: "and", end: "."} 
    |!{element}
```
will output: ```I bought fruits, vegetables and meat.```

## Functions
### Pluralize
You can use ```pluralize.isSingular()``` and ```pluralize.isPlural()``` in a template to check if a word is either singular or plural. Example:  
```
if pluralize.isSingular(explanation.entity)
	|contains
else
	|contain
```  
This will output ```contains``` if the entity field is singular or ```contain``` if the entity field is plural.  

### Random
The random function will return a random element of an array (if the argument is an array) or the argument if it is not an array.  
```
- let nutrient = random(explanation.entity.negative)
- let consequence = random(nutrient.cons_en)
```

## Functions customization
You can also add your own javascript functions to use in pug templates.  
Here I create a function in my JS file which will print the input text two times and then I pass it to RosaeNLG:
### JS file
```
var rosae = require('rosaenlg');

function customFunction(input){
    text = input + " " + input
    return text
}

console.log( rosae.renderFile('testNLG.pug', {
    language: 'en_US',
    double : customFunction
}) );
```  
### PUG template testNLG.pug
```
-let data = ['apples', 'bananas', 'apricots']
|!{double(data[0])}
```  
This will output: ```Apples apples```.
